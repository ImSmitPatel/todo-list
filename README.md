# Todo-list App

This project is a simple and interactive **Todo-list Application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with functionalities such as adding, editing, marking tasks as completed, and deleting all tasks. The application also uses `localStorage` to persist tasks even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**:  
   Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and pressing the "Add" button or pressing the "Enter" key.

2. **Mark Tasks as Completed**:  
   Tasks can be marked as completed using a checkbox. Completed tasks will have a visual indication (strikethrough).

3. **Edit Tasks**:  
   Tasks can be edited by clicking on the task text. Users can modify the task and save the changes.

4. **Delete All Tasks**:  
   Clear the entire task list with the "Delete All" button.

5. **Persistent Storage**:  
   Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they remain even after refreshing or closing the browser.

6. **Dynamic Task Count**:  
   A live count of the total tasks is displayed.
